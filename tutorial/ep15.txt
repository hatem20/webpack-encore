- we have 2 css files to be moved away from public dir and no js file, this is tricky situn coz we webpack
wants always to have js entry file, and if you want css, include it in entryfile, and this comes from SPA mindset
- you have multiple options 1) just leave them there. 2) create js files that only includes css files.
but encore encourage you to do it properly
- add new encore config called 'addStyleEntry' and it's kind of hack as webpack create empty js file and encore
deletes this file later
