- will refactor code so that it works without workarounds (remove global)
- move jquery related code in app.js, but since the code relies on bootstrap, we need to install and import it.
- bootstrap has a dependency (popper.js) but not installed as bootstrap dep, hence we need to manually install it (pear dependenct),
but no need to import it as bootstrap will and also will use jquery as our jquery is not global,
 but webpack is smart enough to load the same instance of jquery.
