-to use sass instead of css rename file, change it in app.js,
then you will find an error with a message on how you should've used css and that's another importance of encore.
-limitation in ecore, you need to restart yarn watch to reload webpack if you change configs.
-rearranged css files in a more elegant structure.
-another cool feature of webpack it looks first for scss files for packages coz we enabled sass, and if it does not have,
it then fallback to css file.
