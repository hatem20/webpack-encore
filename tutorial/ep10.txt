- we want to delete images dir in public and let only single src of truth for images in assets, but
in templates we include images. since `asset` fun reads from public, we need to make some changes.
1-change images routes in all templates to point to build dir instead of public
2-move images to assets.
3-tell encore to copy files from assets to build dir.
- as a bounce we can tweak it a little to take advantage of image versioning out of the box provided by encore.
if we checked the build dir, will find manifest.json, this file is created during build
and it has mapping betn files, its super useful with versioning as it point the file name to the exact versioned file
- another feature called `cleanupOutputBeforeBuild`.
- when we installed encore the recipe added assets.yaml config file which points to the manifest file we talked about,
and this is helpful for asset function to read from
