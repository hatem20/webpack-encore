the real power of webpack, is the ability to import or require js files.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
in js any file you want to use need to export something
- we created file and imported this file in app.js using require keyword
- .js postfix can be omitted in require
- if the file should export more than single function use export default instead, hence will use import '' from
- and you should use import as require is more node, while import is ecmascript.
------------------------------------------------------------------
we just organize our JavaScript without global variables, And that is no small thing.
Heck, we could stop the tutorial right now, and you would still have this amazing superpower.
