- since we created a single entry point, each js and css file will be included in app.js even if we do not need this js code
- will use encore to import external js and css files and also inline js files
- let yarn/npm install third party libs for u. yarn add jquery, and since we need them during build, will add --dev
- after installation, import it as any other js module, but it will be locally imoprted in this very file (app.js),
and can not be used in your twig files, and this is true power of webpack to forget about globals,
but to use it for legacy code you can use global key word, but better soln to refactor your code
