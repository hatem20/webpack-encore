- in this episode we learn how to use babel for js backward compatibility, and postcss for different browsers support
if u checked vendors~admin_article_form.js file you'll find babel rewrite out js code to be compatible wz older browsers,
but you need to tell babel if u need to support older browsers or not.
-apart from babel, in css we may not need webkit key word for new browsers, so there's some encore config we can count on to
add this prefix for us when needed 'postCssLoader'
