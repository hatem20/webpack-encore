code splitting
--------------
it is an optimizn technique
- if we check out source code, will find 2 script tags (app.js, vendor~app.js), and this is a feature
called (splitEntryChunks) can be enabled in webpack.config.js.
- but isn't webpack already merge multiple js files so that we do not make tons of http requests,
how can it be more efficient to split them again to multiple js files?
- yes, and no, webpack extracts vendor files which are less likely to change and combine them into 1 or more file,
also if files are big (30 kb) may be split, also they move shared modules in a file if the shared functionality is too big,
but might not do so is it is easier to be duplicated in each file, and all these optimizations can be customized,
and also wz css files
-- one important
- remember when we used encore_entry_link_tags and encore_entry_script_tags, these helps for import the vendor~app.js files
