-if you searched for -webkit in css file before configuring postcss you can find a certain number, and changing the
required supported browsers will affect this number.
- how to change this ?
in postcss.config.js? no
- there's a lib called browserslist, and this is configured in packages.json.
-check again no of occurrence of -webkit after changing this config.
this also affect js output, eg: it may convert const to var based on the browserslist
