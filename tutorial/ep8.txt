Importing 3rd Party CSS + Image Paths
--------------------------------------
- do the same wz css, replace bootstrap stylesheet with import
- we add import stmt in app.js but, he prefers single css file per entry so will be added via import stmt in styles file
- bootstrap.css is already imported wz import bootstrap we did earlier.
 but how can we import it from modules in the file ?
- we should add the path '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
=> note the tilda is special for css and webpack to know that import from node_module,
- we can omit full path and only suffic with '~bootstrap', just like we did wz js, thanks to "main" key in package.json, it knows the path
css works the same by "style" key but it is not standard yet. you can nit rely on it for every package
- repeat last step wz fontawesome, works as expected + it adds fonts to public wz hash according to the content so that
it caches and invalidate if changed, and update app.css file in public
- will do the same with style.css, but it will be broken since import images in style.css
is relatively so will move entire image dir inside assets
